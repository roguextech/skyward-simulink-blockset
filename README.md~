# skyward-simulink-blockset
This repository contains the Simulink blockset for Sensors used on the calibration platform

# Installation instruction

# LINUX 

* Make sure to have GCC installed (sudo apt-get install gcc g++)
* From MATLAB command window run mex -setup (this will configure the mex compiler)
* Open the IMU.slx S-Function
* Double click on the block, select the desired valuse for S_T (sample time) and build the S-Function (in order to generate tlc and wrapper files)

# WINDOWS

* From Add/Remove programs uninstall "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable" both x86 and x64 version
* Download and install the Windows 7 SDK, make sure to select "Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler" during the setup process
* From MATLAB command line run mex -setup, you should see "MATLAB configured to use Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler"
* Open the IMU.slx S-function
* Double click on the block, select the desired valuse for S_T (sample time) and build the S-Function (in order to generate tlc and wrapper files)

# OS X

* Currently not tested

# TODO

* Script for automatizing the installation procedures

# NOTES  

* When you want to test your algorithm and schemas, make sure to set simulation mode to "External", then click the play button
* When you want to deploy your algorithm to the board, just push the deploy button. Make sure to select Arduino Mega 2560 board from model options, and to set model to fixed-step/discrete
